BeyondHash, the official Proof-of-Work algorithm for the BGC Network, is optimized for general-purpose CPUs and high-end consumer PCs using random code execution and memory-hard techniques to resist specialized ASIC hardware. It employs a custom Virtual Machine with integer math, floating-point math, and branches, translating programs into native CPU code and consolidating outputs using the Blake2b function. BeyondHash has two modes: Fast Mode for mining (requiring 2080 MiB RAM) and Light Mode for verification (requiring 256 MiB RAM), both producing the same results.
